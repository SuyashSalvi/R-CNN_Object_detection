# Object Detection using RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)

This repository contains a Colab notebook demonstrating object detection using the RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) approach. The notebook utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation.

## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. RCNN is a popular approach for object detection that involves generating region proposals and classifying each proposal using a convolutional neural network.

## Contents

- object_detection_rcnn.ipynb: Colab notebook containing the implementation of object detection using RCNN.
- Images.zip: Zip file containing the dataset of images for training and testing.
- Airplanes_Annotations.zip: Zip file containing annotation files for the images, specifying the location of airplanes within each image.

## Usage

Open the object_detection_rcnn.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
