# Object Detection using RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)

This repository contains a Colab notebook demonstrating object detection using the RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) approach. The notebook utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation.

## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. RCNN is a popular approach for object detection that involves generating region proposals and classifying each proposal using a convolutional neural network.

## Contents

- object_detection_rcnn.ipynb: Colab notebook containing the implementation of object detection using RCNN.
- Images.zip: Zip file containing the dataset of images for training and testing.
- Airplanes_Annotations.zip: Zip file containing annotation files for the images, specifying the location of airplanes within each image.

## Usage

Open the object_detection_rcnn.ipynb notebook in Google Colab. 
Mount your Google Drive to access the required files.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each code cell sequentially.
Train the RCNN model using the provided dataset and evaluate its performance.
Save the trained model for future use or deployment.

## Requirements

Google Colab account (for running the notebook)
Python 3.x
